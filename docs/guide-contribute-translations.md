You can contribute translations in three ways:
<ol>
   <li> Translate the platform into additional languages </li>
   <li> Sign up as a proofreader to review and approve new translations </li>

We use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/citizenlabdotcocitizenlab) to manage our translations. If you have typos or copy suggestions, you can make them there directly by selecting the language and joining the project.
