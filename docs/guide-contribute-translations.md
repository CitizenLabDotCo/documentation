---

The CitizenLab platform is currently available in the following languages:
<ul>
   <li>English</li>
   <li>Danish()</li>
   <li>Dutch</li>
   <li>French</li>
   <li>German()</li>
   <li>Norwegian()</li>
   <li>Polish</li>
   <li>Portuguese</li>
   <li>Romanian()</li>
   <li>Spanish</li>
</ul>
   

() = only the public facing parts of the platform are available in this language. The administrative interface (where you manage and configure participation projects, etc.) has not been translated.

You can contribute translations in three ways:
<ol>
   <li> Translate the platform into additional languages </li>
   <li> Sign up as a proofreader to review and approve new translations </li>
   <li> Suggest improvements to existing copy and translations (typos, style, etc.) </li>
</ol>

We use CrowdIn to manage our translations and will open that up so translations and copy suggestions can be made there directly.

Please contact julienne@citizenlab.co if you're interested in adding a language to the platform or would like to become a proofreader to approve suggested translations!
