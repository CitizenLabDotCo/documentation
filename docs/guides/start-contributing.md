We're happy that you're reading this! 
We'd love this digital participation platform to be a place to which everyone can contribute.

Do you need changes to the current version of the platform to make it fit your specific needs or local context?
You've come to the right place!

# Code contributions
Did you customize your locally deployed code? And do you believe your changes can be of value to the wider community?
You can submit them as Pull Request, after which we will consider adding them to the shared codebase.

Do you want some feedback before submitting? Go to the [Discussions page](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab/discussions), and start a new discussion within the 'Show and tell' category. We will get back to you.

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request to Go Vocal. 
Split your work in 1 commit per feature that you've added or edited.
Always write a clear log message for your commits that look like this:

> $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
