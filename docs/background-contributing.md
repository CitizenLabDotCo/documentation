We're happy that you're reading this! 
We'd love this digital participation platform to be a place to which everyone can contribute.

Do you need schanges to the current version of the platform to make it fit your specific needs or local context?
You've come to the right place!

# Code contributions
Did you customize your locally deployed code? And do you believe your changes can be of value to the wider community?
You can submit them as Pull Request, after which we will consider adding them to the shared codebase.

Do you want some feedback before submitting? Go to the [Discussions page](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab/discussions), and start a new discussion within the 'Show and tell' category. We will get back to you.
