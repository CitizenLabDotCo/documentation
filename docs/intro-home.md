CitizenLab is a community engagement platform used by local governments & organizations to connect with residents & engage them in decision-making.

### Who is this for?

If you're a software enthusiast or a developer who wants to get their hands dirty, this portal is for you. We'll help you get started with the platform, bring online the open-source version, interact with the API (commercial version) and give you some direction on how to adapt it to your needs.


### Our open-source model

CitizenLab adopts a so-called **[open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model)**, which means that there are two product editions available:
* CitizenLab Open-Source Edition, including core fuctionalities, freely available under the AGPLv3 license. This edition is designed for small organisations running an occassional engagement project. The code can be found in our [citizenlab-oss](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab) Github repository.

* CitizenLab Commercial Edition, including [extra features](https://www.citizenlab.co/plans) described under Standard/Premium, available under the paid commercial license. This edition is your best option if you plan to run multiple engagement projects, in order to have access to more back-office functionalities to manage your platform efficiently. The code is source-available and can be found in our main [citizenlab](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/citizenlab) Github repository, for transparency and contribution sake.
