title: About CitizenLab
---

[CitizenLab](https://www.citizenlab.co) is a **digital democracy platform that facilitates communication and co-creation between cities and their communities**. Residents can post, discuss, and upvote their own ideas, or choose to vote, prioritize, and fund projects that their city is considering. **275+ cities around the world** use CitizenLab to engage, consult, and deliberate with their residents and manage their input - both asynchronously and live through their one-of-a-kind workshops feature that brings the sense of community to the digital era. The company was founded in Belgium and has quickly expanded across Europe, and within new markets in the UK, Chile, and most recently in the US.

## Why do we believe open-source is important?
Weâ€™re going open source because our team is committed to further lowering the threshold to participation and to increasing transparency along the way. **After all, democracy belongs to all of us.** Going open-source means more ideas can be shared and implemented to bring about positive change for more communities. By making our platform more accessible to all civic organizations and removing some barriers to participation, more institutions will have the chance to launch consultation projects, create stronger links with their communities, and harness the power of collective intelligence.
