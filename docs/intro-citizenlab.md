title: About CitizenLab
---

[CitizenLab](https://www.citizenlab.co) is a digital democracy platform that facilitates communication and co-creation between cities and their communities. Residents can post, discuss, and upvote their own ideas, or choose to vote, prioritize, and fund projects that their city is considering. 200+ cities around the world use CitizenLab to engage, consult, and deliberate with their residents and manage their input - both asynchronously and live through their one-of-a-kind workshops feature that brings the sense of community to the digital era. The company was founded in Belgium and has quickly expanded across Europe, and within new markets in the UK, Chile, and most recently in the US.
