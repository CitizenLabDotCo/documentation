title: About CitizenLab
---

[CitizenLab](https://www.citizenlab.co) is a **digital democracy platform that facilitates communication and co-creation between cities and their communities**. Residents can post, discuss, and upvote their own ideas, or choose to vote, prioritize, and fund projects that their city is considering. **200+ cities around the world** use CitizenLab to engage, consult, and deliberate with their residents and manage their input - both asynchronously and live through their one-of-a-kind workshops feature that brings the sense of community to the digital era. The company was founded in Belgium and has quickly expanded across Europe, and within new markets in the UK, Chile, and most recently in the US.

## Why we believe open-source is important?
Democracy belongs to all of us, and the algorithms shaping our institutions should be visible to everyone. By opening up our code, we are practicing what we preach and **strengthening community engagement by increasing transparency**.

As a company dedicated to making a positive social impact, we also prioritize purpose over profit. Being open-source means **we can continue to remove barriers to participation and give even more communities access to the platform**.
