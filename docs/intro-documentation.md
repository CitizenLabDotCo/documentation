title: Finding your way
---

This documentation website follows the guidlines laid out by the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/). 

There isn't one thing called documentation, but there are four. This means that the documentation is structured around 4 different user needs:

### Tutorials
Learn something very concrete and fast, to get you started

### Guides
Learn something more advanced

### Reference
Find information that describes the system

### Background
Extra information that elaborates further on certain subjects without an immediate end goal.

:::note
This documentation website is open-source itself. Did you spot a mistake? Do you want to suggest an improvement? We welcome [contributions](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/documentation)
