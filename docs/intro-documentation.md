title: Finding your way
---

This documentation website follows the conventions laid out by the [divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com). 

There isn't one thing called documentation, but there are four. This means that the documentation is structured around 4 different perspectives:

### Tutorials
Learn something very concrete and fast, to get you started

### Guides
Learn something more advanced

### Reference

### Background
Extra information that elaborates further on certain subjects without an immediate end goal.

This documentation website is open-source itself. Did you spot a mistake? Do you want to suggest an improvement? We welcome [contributions](https://github.com/CitizenLabDotCo/documentation)
